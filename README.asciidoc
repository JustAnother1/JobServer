= Job Server

Controls distribution of Jobs to clients.


== HOW TO BUILD?

I've provided a simple maven build script.
So running with maven installed should be a simple:

+$ mvn verify+

+$ java -jar target/JobServer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar+


== Protocol

The communication is done over a not encrypted TCP connection. In command line interface style.
The clients are the TCP Severs that the Job Server connects to.
